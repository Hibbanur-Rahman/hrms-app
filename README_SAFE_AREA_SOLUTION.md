# Safe Area Handling Solution

## Overview
This solution addresses the issue where app content goes behind the status bar on newer mobile devices with notches, dynamic islands, or edge-to-edge displays.

## Changes Made

### 1. App.tsx
- Added `SafeAreaProvider` wrapper around the entire app
- Added `StatusBar` configuration with translucent property
- Imported necessary dependencies from `react-native-safe-area-context`

### 2. SafeAreaWrapper Component
Created a reusable component (`src/components/SafeAreaWrapper.tsx`) that can be used in any screen for consistent safe area handling.

## How It Works

### Global Solution
The `SafeAreaProvider` in `App.tsx` provides safe area context to all child components throughout the app. This ensures that:
- All screens have access to safe area insets
- Status bar is properly configured for transparency
- The app content respects device-specific safe areas

### Component-Level Solution
The `SafeAreaWrapper` component can be used in individual screens for more granular control:

```tsx
import SafeAreaWrapper from '../components/SafeAreaWrapper';

const YourScreen = () => {
  return (
    <SafeAreaWrapper backgroundColor="#f5f5f5" statusBarStyle="dark-content">
      {/* Your screen content */}
    </SafeAreaWrapper>
  );
};
```

## Usage Guidelines

### For Existing Screens with SafeAreaView
Most screens already use `SafeAreaView` which should now work properly with the global `SafeAreaProvider`.

### For New Screens
Use either:
1. `SafeAreaView` from React Native (recommended for most cases)
2. `SafeAreaWrapper` component for more customization

### For Screens with Issues
If you notice any screen still having issues, wrap the content with `SafeAreaWrapper`:

```tsx
import SafeAreaWrapper from '../components/SafeAreaWrapper';

const ProblematicScreen = () => {
  return (
    <SafeAreaWrapper className="flex-1 bg-gray-50">
      {/* Your existing content */}
    </SafeAreaWrapper>
  );
};
```

## Benefits
- ✅ Consistent safe area handling across all devices
- ✅ Proper status bar configuration
- ✅ No content hidden behind notches or status bars
- ✅ Works on both iOS and Android
- ✅ Future-proof for new device form factors

## Testing
Test on:
- Devices with notches (iPhone X and newer)
- Devices with dynamic islands (iPhone 14 Pro series)
- Android devices with different status bar configurations
- Different screen orientations

## Notes
- The solution is backward compatible
- Existing `SafeAreaView` usage will continue to work
- The `react-native-safe-area-context` library was already installed
- No additional dependencies required
