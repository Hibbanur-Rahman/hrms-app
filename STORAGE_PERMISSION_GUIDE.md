# Storage Permission Issues and Solutions

## Problem
When users click "Don't ask again" for storage permissions on Android, the permission status becomes `never_ask_again` and the permission dialog won't show again.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Permission Checking
- First check if permission is already granted using `PermissionsAndroid.check()`
- Handle different permission results including `never_ask_again`
- Provide clear guidance to users on how to enable permissions manually

### 2. Android Version Compatibility
- **Android 11+ (API 30+)**: Uses scoped storage - app can write to its own external files directory without permissions
- **Android 10 and below**: Requires WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission for Downloads folder

### 3. Fallback Strategies
- If permissions are denied permanently, guide users to app settings
- For Android 11+, use app's document directory that doesn't require permissions
- Provide clear messaging about where files are saved

### 4. User Experience Improvements
- Clear permission request messages
- "Open Settings" button when permissions are permanently denied
- Different download locations based on Android version
- Success messages indicating where files are saved

## Testing Steps

### For Never Ask Again Issue:
1. **Clear App Data**: Go to Settings > Apps > [Your App] > Storage > Clear Data
2. **Reset Permissions**: Settings > Apps > [Your App] > Permissions > Reset permissions
3. **Test Permission Flow**: 
   - First time: Should show permission dialog
   - Grant: Should work normally
   - Deny: Should show error message
   - Deny with "Don't ask again": Should show "Open Settings" option

### For Android 11+ Testing:
1. Test on Android 11+ device
2. Should automatically use app's document directory
3. Should not require storage permissions
4. Files should be accessible through file manager

## Alternative Solutions

If issues persist, consider these alternatives:

### 1. Use Media Store API (Android 10+)
```javascript
// Use React Native's built-in share functionality
import { Share } from 'react-native';
await Share.share({
  url: 'data:application/pdf;base64,' + pdfBase64Data,
  title: 'Salary Slip'
});
```

### 2. Use Download Manager
```javascript
// Let system handle the download
const downloadUrl = await uploadToTempServer(pdfData);
Linking.openURL(downloadUrl);
```

### 3. Use Share Menu
```javascript
// Always offer share instead of direct download
const shareResult = await Share.share({
  title: 'Salary Slip',
  message: 'Please find your salary slip attached',
  url: pdfFilePath,
});
```
