## Dependencies
- `react-native-linear-gradient`: For gradient backgrounds

## Customization

### Loading Steps
You can customize the loading steps by modifying the `loadingSteps` array:

```tsx
const loadingSteps: LoadingStep[] = [
  { icon: '🔐', text: 'Your Custom Text', duration: 800 },
  // Add more steps as needed
];
```

### Colors and Styling
The component uses a purple gradient theme. You can modify the colors in the `LinearGradient` component and the styles object.

### Animation Timing
Adjust animation durations by modifying the `duration` values in the `loadingSteps` array and the animation timing in the `useEffect` hook.

## Performance
- Uses `useNativeDriver: true` for most animations for optimal performance
- Efficient cleanup of animations in the `useEffect` cleanup function
- Minimal re-renders with proper state management

## Accessibility
- High contrast colors for better visibility
- Clear text descriptions for each loading step
- Proper font sizing for readability
